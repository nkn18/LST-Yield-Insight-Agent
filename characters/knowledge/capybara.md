# Capybara DEX Overview

Capybara Exchange is a decentralized exchange platform but also offering liquidity staking token opportunities. Here's how the system works:

1. Access: Visit https://dex.capybara.exchange/en/pool
2. Liquidity Staking: 
   - Users deposit their tokens to receive liquid staking tokens (LSTs)
   - LSTs represent the staked position while maintaining liquidity
   - Each pool has its own coverage ratio and staking rewards
3. Staking LP Tokens:
   - LP tokens can be staked for additional rewards
   - Staking rewards are distributed continuously
   - APR varies by pool and market conditions
